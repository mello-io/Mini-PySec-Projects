<h1> Mini-PySec-Projects </h1>

These are small scale locally deployable python projects for offensive and defensive security.

These projects are made with guidance from Tryhackme. And if you are a beginner and would like to make something like this too, check in <a href="https://tryhackme.com/module/scripting-for-pentesters"> here </a> for some great steps and methods. Feel free to test these projects locally and share me your thoughts, suggestions and code improvement via my Linkedin.
